### What I learned

While working through this project I could learn more about CSS custom properties and how to organize better my code.


```html
<title>Frontend Mentor | QR code component</title>
```
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    .container {
        margin: 15% auto;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing in learn more about styling and structure for the code. Also implementing funcionality adding pogramming language and frameworks as React.

### Useful resources

## Acknowledgments

As a junior developer I find a good documentation and examples that can help everyone who wants to build or add components to a project. There are many sides that can help us to find solutions and to use better programming practices (#useful-resources).
